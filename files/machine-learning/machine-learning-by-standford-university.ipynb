    "- Definition of machine learning defined by many computer scientists:\n",

    "    - Tom Mitchell (1998): Well-posed learning problem: A computer program is said to *learn* from experience $E$ with respect to some task $T$ and some performance measure $P$, if its performance on $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.\n",
    "- Types of machine learning algorithms:\n",

    "#### Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "![Gradient descent algorithm](images/2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is algorithm which can be used to minimize cost function $J$, and other type of problems. The basic concept of gradent descent algorithm is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with some $\\theta_0$, $\\theta_1$\n",
    "- Keep changing $\\theta_0$, $\\theta_1$ to reduce $J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)$ until minimum\n",

    "- $:=$ is assignment operator\n",
    "- $=$ is truth assertion\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ is learning rate, or simply *the big of step we take downhill with creating descent*\n",
    "- $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)$ is derivative term\n",

    "#### Gradient Descent Intuition\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![The derivative term explanation](images/4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate $\\alpha$ is responsible to define move rate until convergence. If $\\alpha$ is too small, gredient descent can be slow, but if $\\alpha$ is too large, gradient descent can overshoot the minimum. It may fail to converge, or even diverge.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we approach a local minimum, gradient descent will automatically take smaller steps. So, no need to decrease learning rate $\\alpha$ over time.\n",

    "#### Matrices and Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matrix: rectangular array of numbers\n",
    "- Dimension of matrix: number of rows * number of columns\n",
    "- $A_ij$ refers to the element in the $i_{th}$ row and $j_{th}$ column of matrix A.\n",
    "- A vector with 'n' rows is referred to as an 'n'-dimensional vector. Only one column.\n",
    "- $v_i$ refers to the element in the $i_{th}$ row of the vector.\n",
    "- In general, all our vectors and matrices will be 1-indexed. Note that for some programming languages, the arrays are 0-indexed.\n",
    "- Matrices are usually denoted by uppercase names while vectors are lowercase.\n",
    "- \"Scalar\" means that an object is a single value, not a vector or matrix.\n",
    "- $‚Ñù$ refers to the set of scalar real numbers.\n",
    "- $‚Ñù^ùïü$ refers to the set of n-dimensional vectors of real numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Addition and Scalar Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "- Addition and substraction on matrix can be done by taking each $A_ij$ and $B_ij$ and add together, but $A$ and $B$ must be same diemnsion.\n",
    "- Scalar multiplication and division can be done by taking the number and multiply each element on $A$ one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multi-vector Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "We map the column of the vector onto each row of the matrix, multiplying each element and summing the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\newline c & d \\newline e & f \\end{bmatrix} *\\begin{bmatrix} x \\newline y \\newline \\end{bmatrix} =\\begin{bmatrix} a*x + b*y \\newline c*x + d*y \\newline e*x + f*y\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a vector. The number of columns of the matrix must equal the number of rows of the vector. An m x n matrix multiplied by an n x 1 vector results in an m x 1 vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix-matrix multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "We multiply two matrices by breaking it into several vector multiplications and concatenating the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\newline c & d \\newline e & f \\end{bmatrix} *\\begin{bmatrix} w & x \\newline y & z \\newline \\end{bmatrix} =\\begin{bmatrix} a*w + b*y & a*x + b*z \\newline c*w + d*y & c*x + d*z \\newline e*w + f*y & e*x + f*z\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An m x n matrix multiplied by an n x o matrix results in an m x o matrix. In the above example, a 3 x 2 matrix times a 2 x 2 matrix resulted in a 3 x 2 matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "To multiply two matrices, the number of columns of the first matrix must equal the number of rows of the second matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Multiplication Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matrices are not commutative: $A‚àóB \\neq B‚àóA$\n",
    "- Matrices are associative: $(A‚àóB)‚àóC =  A‚àó(B‚àóC)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **identity matrix**, when multiplied by any matrix of the same dimensions, results in the original matrix. It's just like multiplying numbers by 1. The identity matrix simply has 1's on the diagonal (upper left to lower right diagonal) and 0's elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\newline 0 & 1 & 0 \\newline 0 & 0 & 1 \\newline \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiplying the identity matrix after some matrix (A‚àóI), the square identity matrix's dimension should match the other matrix's columns. When multiplying the identity matrix before some other matrix (I‚àóA), the square identity matrix's dimension should match the other matrix's rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inverse and Transpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The **inverse** of a matrix A is denoted $A^{-1}$. Multiplying by the inverse results in the identity matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "A non square matrix does not have an inverse matrix. We can compute inverses of matrices in octave with the $pinv(A)$ function and in Matlab with the $inv(A)$ function. Matrices that don't have an inverse are *singular* or *degenerate*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **transposition** of a matrix is like rotating the matrix 90¬∞ in clockwise direction and then reversing it. We can compute transposition of matrices in matlab with the transpose(A) function or A':\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\newline c & d \\newline e & f \\end{bmatrix}; A^T = \\begin{bmatrix} a & c & e \\newline b & d & f \\newline \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A_{ij} = A^T_{ji}$$\n",

    "### Multivariate Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression with multiple variables is also known as \"multivariate linear regression\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We now introduce notation for equations where we can have any number of input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}x_j^{(i)} &= \\text{value of feature } j \\text{ in the }i^{th}\\text{ training example} \\newline x^{(i)}& = \\text{the input (features) of the }i^{th}\\text{ training example} \\newline m &= \\text{the number of training examples} \\newline n &= \\text{the number of features} \\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The multivariable form of the hypothesis function accommodating these multiple features is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_\\theta (x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_2 + \\theta_3 x_3 + \\cdots + \\theta_n x_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to develop intuition about this function, we can think about $Œ∏_0$ as the basic price of a house, $Œ∏_1$ as the price per square meter, $Œ∏_2$ as the price per floor, etc. $x_1$ will be the number of square meters in the house, $x_2$ the number of floors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the definition of matrix multiplication, our multivariable hypothesis function can be concisely represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}h_\\theta(x) =\\begin{bmatrix}\\theta_0 \\hspace{2em} \\theta_1 \\hspace{2em} ... \\hspace{2em} \\theta_n\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline \\vdots \\newline x_n\\end{bmatrix}= \\theta^T x\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a vectorization of our hypothesis function for one training example; see the lessons on vectorization to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remark: Note that for convenience reasons in this course we assume $x(i)0=1 for (i‚àà1,‚Ä¶,m)$. This allows us to do matrix operations with theta and $x$. Hence making the two vectors '$Œ∏$' and $x^(i)$ match each other element-wise (that is, have the same number of elements: $n+1$).]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient Descent for Multiple Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient descent equation itself is generally the same form; we just have to repeat it for our 'n' features:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*} & \\text{repeat until convergence:} \\; \\lbrace \\newline \\; & \\theta_0 := \\theta_0 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_0^{(i)}\\newline \\; & \\theta_1 := \\theta_1 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_1^{(i)} \\newline \\; & \\theta_2 := \\theta_2 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_2^{(i)} \\newline & \\cdots \\newline \\rbrace \\end{align*}$$\n",
