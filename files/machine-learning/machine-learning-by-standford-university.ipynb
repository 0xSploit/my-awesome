    "#### What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Definition of machine learning defined by many computer scientists:\n",
    "    - Arthur Samuel (1959): Machine learning is field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "    - Tom Mitchell (1998): Well-posed learning problem: A computer program is said to *learn* from experience $E$ with respect to some task $T$ and some performance measure $P$, if its performance on $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.\n",
    "- Types of machine learning algorithms:\n",
    "    - **Supervised learning**: teach the computer how to do something\n",
    "    - **Unsupervices learning**: let computer learn but itself\n",
    "    - Others:\n",
    "        - Reinforcement learning\n",

    "- **Definition**: Give the computer a data set in which the right answer were given. Computer then resposible for producing *more* right answer from what we were given.\n",
    "- Type of problems on supervised learning\n",
    "    - **Regression problem**: try to predict continuous (real) valued output e.g. house pricing.\n",
    "    - **Classification problem**: discrete valued output(s) e.g. probability of breast cancer (nalignant, benign) based on tumor size as attribute or feature. \n",

In this situation, **mean squared error (MSE)** or **mean squared division (MSD)** can be used to measure the average of the squares of the errors or deviations. The cost function of this problem can be described by the MSE as:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Start with some $\\theta_0$, $\\theta_1$\n",
    "- Keep changing $\\theta_0$, $\\theta_1$ to reduce $J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)$ until minimum\n",

    "- $:=$ is assignment operator\n",
    "- $=$ is truth assertion\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ is learning rate, or simply *the big of step we take downhill with creating descent*\n",
    "- $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)$ is derivative term\n",

    "#### Gradient Descent Intuition\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![The derivative term explanation](images/4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate $\\alpha$ is responsible to define move rate until convergence. If $\\alpha$ is too small, gredient descent can be slow, but if $\\alpha$ is too large, gradient descent can overshoot the minimum. It may fail to converge, or even diverge.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we approach a local minimum, gradient descent will automatically take smaller steps. So, no need to decrease learning rate $\\alpha$ over time.\n",
